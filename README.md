# 🏭 Production Performance Analysis Dashboard

> *"The expert in anything was once a beginner."*  
> This project began as a learning journey and evolved into a comprehensive BI solution for analyzing manufacturing performance using Power BI.

---

## 🎯 Overview

This **Power BI dashboard** was developed to help manufacturing companies monitor and improve their production processes. It enables users to visualize key metrics such as **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**, **downtime impact**, **material efficiency**, and **defect rates** across multiple production lines, shifts, and machines.

The goal of this project was to:
- Track production efficiency and output
- Identify bottlenecks and downtime causes
- Monitor quality control and defect trends
- Optimize resource utilization (labor, materials, energy)

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Data Modeling**:  
  Built a relational data model with over **300,000 rows across 5 years**, including tables for:
  - Production Output
  - Machine Performance & Downtime
  - Resource Utilization
  - Shifts & Labor Hours
  - Product Specifications

- **KPI Development**:  
  Created advanced KPIs using **DAX**, including:
  - OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)
  - Downtime Impact
  - Material Usage Efficiency
  - Defect Rate
  - Labor Utilization

- **Dashboard Sections**:  
  Designed interactive dashboards covering:
  - Production Overview
  - Resource Utilization Analysis
  - Downtime & Bottleneck Analysis
  - Quality Control Metrics

- **Visualizations**:  
  Used advanced visuals like:
  - Line charts for production trends
  - Pareto charts for root cause analysis
  - Heatmaps for machine utilization
  - Bar charts for defect distribution
  - Drill-through pages for deeper insights

## 🔍 Insights & Recommendations

Based on the analysis:
- Identified **top-performing and underperforming production lines**
- Detected **overused machines** causing bottlenecks
- Highlighted **shifts with higher defect rates**
- Provided actionable recommendations to reduce downtime and optimize material usage
